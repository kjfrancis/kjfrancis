            <h2>About Fulcrum Point Construction</h2>
            <p><strong>Work smarter, not harder.</strong></p>
            <p>Simple machines are tools that make work easier. They allow a small force to oversome a large force. And the fulcrum point? That's the magical place where you can change position and gain extra power with less effort. This is the mission of Fulcrum Point Construction - we get you the leverage you need to meet your goals and achieve excellence for years to come.</p>

            <p class="personalWords"><em>"I like to think as long term as possible. My big beef with the way the world works is there isn't anything ahead of 3-5 years. I want to make as much of a positive impact...and pass it on just like it was passed on to me."</em></p>

            <p><strong>Calm experience in peaks and valleys.</strong></p>
            <p>Always fascinated with taking things apart and putting them back together, Dmitry Gribov was destined to break down and solve complex issues.</p>

            <p>During the 2007 Bay Area construction slow down, Dmitry began working with a couple of general contractors who took a shine to his work style and ethic. But it was a simple Craigslist ad that connected him to Christopher Gate Construction where he cut his teeth on all aspects of building and construction. It was these formative in-depth experiences that gave Dmitry the drive to venture out on his own as a general contractor launching Fulcrum Point Construction.</p>
       
                        <p><strong>A trusted advisor.</strong></p>

                        <p class="personalWords"><em><span>"I'm all for having somebody know why that's the best way to do something. To have a reason and explanation for everything you do so that it checks out is an important way to really do anything."</span></em></p>

                        <p>The 2015 birth of Fulcrum Point Construction was during the ongoing construction boom in the San Francisco area. And despite the current plethora of work available, Fulcrum Point strives to take on creative challenges, new applications and continue to collaborate with like minded clientele, trades, and colleagues who take pride in their work. Above all, we strive to be the leverage you need to make your project shine inside and out.</p>

                <p><em>"The quality of the work was excellent. The molding he put in matched the existing Victorian molding perfectly. Even performed some magic on wainscoting, moving a section as we could not find replacement wainscoting. He was right on budget. We would recommend Dmitry wholeheartedly."</em> <span class="quoteName">- M. Tcheng</span></p>
